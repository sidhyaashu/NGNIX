# Nginx Learning Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the step-by-step learning path to master Nginx, from basic web server tasks to advanced configurations like load balancing and security.

## 1. Introduction to Nginx
- **What is Nginx?**: Understand the basics of Nginx as a web server, reverse proxy, and load balancer.
- **Installation**: Learn how to install Nginx on various platforms.
  - Example (Ubuntu/Debian): `sudo apt install nginx`
- **Basic Commands**: Start, stop, and restart Nginx services.
  - Example: `sudo systemctl start nginx`

## 2. Basic Configuration
- **Nginx Directory Structure**: Explore configuration files (`nginx.conf`, `sites-available/`, `sites-enabled/`).
- **Serving Static Websites**: Configure Nginx to serve static files.
- **Virtual Hosts**: Set up server blocks to manage multiple websites.

## 3. Reverse Proxy
- **Introduction to Reverse Proxy**: Learn the purpose of Nginx as a reverse proxy.
- **Configure Reverse Proxy**: Forward client requests to backend servers (e.g., Node.js, Python Flask).
- **Load Balancing**: Set up Nginx to distribute traffic across backend servers.

## 4. Security
- **SSL/TLS Configuration**: Secure Nginx with SSL/TLS certificates (Let's Encrypt, self-signed).
- **HTTP to HTTPS Redirect**: Automatically redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS.
- **Rate Limiting and Access Control**: Implement rate limiting and block IPs to prevent DDoS attacks.

## 5. Advanced Topics
- **Caching with Nginx**: Configure caching to improve performance.
- **Gzip Compression**: Enable Gzip to reduce data transfer size.
- **Custom Error Pages**: Set up custom error pages for HTTP status codes (404, 500, etc.).

## 6. Performance Tuning
- **Worker Processes and Connections**: Optimize worker processes and connection limits for better performance.
- **Buffering and Timeouts**: Adjust buffer settings and timeouts for improved performance under load.

## 7. Monitoring and Logging
- **Access and Error Logs**: Learn how to analyze access and error logs.
- **Monitoring Tools**: Use `ngxtop`, Prometheus, Grafana, etc., for performance monitoring.

## 8. Nginx with Docker
- **Using Nginx in Docker**: Learn to run Nginx inside a Docker container.
- **Docker Compose**: Set up Nginx in a multi-container application using Docker Compose.

## 9. Nginx as a Load Balancer
- **Load Balancing Algorithms**: Explore algorithms like round-robin and least connections.
- **Health Checks**: Implement health checks to route traffic to healthy backend servers.

## 10. Nginx with Microservices
- **Service Discovery**: Configure Nginx for service discovery in microservices.
- **Dynamic Upstreams**: Manage upstream servers dynamically for microservices architecture.

## 11. Troubleshooting
- **Debugging Nginx Issues**: Troubleshoot common issues like misconfigurations and SSL problems.
- **Using Debug Mode**: Enable debug mode for detailed logs.

## Learning Resources
- **Official Nginx Documentation**: [Nginx Docs](https://nginx.org/en/docs/)
- **Books**: *Nginx: A Practical Guide to High Performance*
- **Online Courses**: Find courses on platforms like Udemy, Coursera, or Pluralsight.

## Practice Projects
- Set up an Nginx web server to host static websites.
- Use Nginx as a reverse proxy for a Node.js or Flask application.
- Implement SSL/TLS encryption and redirect HTTP to HTTPS.
- Configure Nginx in Docker for a multi-container app.

By following this roadmap, youâ€™ll gain a comprehensive understanding of Nginx, from basic to advanced topics.
