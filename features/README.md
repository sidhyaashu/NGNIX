6. **Compression**: Reduces data size for faster web page loading.
7. **Fast & Lightweight**: Uses minimal resources, handling high traffic smoothly.
8. **Security**: Offers basic security features like firewall setups and request filtering.
9. **HTTP/2 and gRPC Support**: Works with modern web protocols for better speed and performance.
